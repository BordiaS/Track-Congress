# Track-Congress

We use news reports, the congressional record, election results, and congressional voting records to analyze the tendencies of United States congress-women and -men. We use NLP and sentiment analysis to process the congressional record and news stories, and link those datasets by date. 

The congressional record data will also be tagged by the congress-people contributing, which will be linked to their election results and voting record. We use descriptive statistics to determine trends and outliers in congressional behavior. Additionally, we will examine correlations between behavior and the news, using election results and voting records as additional features.
